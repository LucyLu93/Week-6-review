# Week 6 Review



## Installation and Such

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Run all tests: `npm test`
1. Remember that you can specify an individual test file: `npm test test/hofs.test.js`


## Part 1: HOFs

There are three functions to write in `src/hofs.js`.
Their corresponding tests are in `test/hofs.test.js`.

- Only use HOFs! No `for` (or `while`) loops allowed!
- Look at the tests to get a better idea what your functions should return.


## Part 2: Classes and Tests

This exercise is based on the idea of a drawing tool that has different shapes.
It involves these classes: `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Shape` and `Group`.
Some of the code is already written for you.
Your job is to write code where you find `FIX ME` comments.

Follow these steps:

1. `Shape` is the parent class of `Rectangle` and `Circle`. The tests are already written. Replace `FIX ME` in `Shape.js`. Look at the test to see what is expected.
1. A few things need to be fixed in the `Rectangle` class and its corresponding test file.
1. Similarly, the `Circle` class and its tests need some fixing.
1. **BONUS**: The `Group` class lets us combine primitive shapes to make more complex ones. The tests are done, but the class needs some fixing.
