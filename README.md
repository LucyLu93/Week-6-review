# Week 6 Review


## To Do

- #1 is too easy

## Installation and Such

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Run the tests: `npm test`


## Part 1: HOFs

There are three functions to write in `src/hofs.js`.
Their corresponding tests are in `test/hofs.test.js`.

- Only use HOFs! No `for` or `while` loops allowed!
- To enable a test, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in `test/hofs.test.js`.
- Look at the tests to get a better idea what your functions should return.



## Part 2: Classes and Tests

This exercise is based on the idea of a drawing tool that has different shapes.
It involves these classes: `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Shape` and `Group`.
Some of the code is already written for you.
Your job is to write code where you find `FIX ME` comments.

Follow these steps:

1. `Shape` is the parent class of `Rectangle` and `Circle`. The tests are already written. Replace `FIX ME` in `Shape.js`. Look at the test to see what is expected.
1. [taking a break...]
